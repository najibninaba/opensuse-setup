# Setup Notes

- Install _Spotify_ via this script: https://github.com/megamaced/spotify-easyrpm
- Install _VLC_ from here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-suse.html or use the Packman repos
- Get the latest Fedora package for Slack and follow the instructions here: https://flanaras.wordpress.com/2016/03/29/install-slack-on-opensuse-leap-42-1/
- I use Crossover Linux for running things like Evernote (only the latest 5.18.x.x series) and Hearthstone

- For running VMs, I use QEMU/KVM 
- I need to set the following in order to do things like USB redirection:
    chmod u+s /usr/bin/spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper
